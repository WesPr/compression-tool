### This is a Kotlin (Spring Boot) implementation of a Compression Tool using Huffman encoding/decoding.

#### Compression Results:

* Original File -> 3.291 KB
* Compressed File -> 1.927 KB

##### Basics of compression:

1. Read the file and determine the frequency of each character occurring.
2. Build the binary tree from the frequencies.
3. Generate the prefix-code table from the tree.
4. Encode the text using the code table.
5. Encode the tree - included in the output file so we can decode it.
6. Write the encoded tree and text to an output file

##### Basics of decompression:

1. Read the file and retrieve header and body.
2. Convert to binary
3. Replace body with codewords
4. Convert from bits to ByteArray
5. Write decompressed file.
